TODO:
instructions
which cavern you came from

--------------------------------
You need a key to open one of the two doors leading out of the Catacombs.
Beware the terrible monsters inhabiting the Catacombs. Once they find you, they will hunt you mercilessly. 
The Orcs are mostly a nuisance, but they dig pits for you to fall in.
The Goblins are a bit more dangerous; try to pick them off using you bow and arrows.
The Giant Serpents are very dagnerous and difficult to kill. They are fairly slow, but the leave poisonous muck behind...
The Dragon is asleep at the beginning of the game. Try not to wake him, unless you have the legendary Dragon Sword. If not, your only option is to run as fast as you can!
To begin with, you have only a bow and arrows (a human has an axe as well). Use them wisely, as you only have a limited amount of arrows. Once you find an axe you can fight the monsters in the same cavern, but you will rarely emerge unscathed from a fight.
If you are lucky, a wizard may offer to sell you a Magic Staff. Buy one if you can, especially if you are a Wizard or an Elf!
The Hermit knows the layout of the Catacombs. He may help you escape if you find him.
