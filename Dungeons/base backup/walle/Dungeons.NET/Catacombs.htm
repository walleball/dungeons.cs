<h1>The Catacombs</h1>
The Catacombs is a text-based adventure game for the T610 Ericsson phone, although it may well work with any device supporting J2ME. I originally wrote the Catacombs game for the ZX81 back in the early 80's and not much have been changed for the T610 version. The inspiration was an article about the "Hunt the Wumpus" game.
The original texts have been retained, although a bit shortened to fit on the display of the phone.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
You have been trapped inside the Catacombs and your goal is to survive by finding a key and escaping through one of the doors leading to freedom.
Beware the terrible monsters that inhabit the Catacombs. Once they find you they will hunt you mercilessly.
The Orcs are mostly a nuisance, but they dig deadly pits for you to fall in.
The Goblins are a bit more dangerous. Try to pick them off using your bow and arrows.
The Giant Serpents are very dangerous and difficult to kill. They are fairly slow, but they leave poisonous muck behind.
The Dragon is asleep in his lair and won't bother you unless you disturb him. Try not to wake him unless you possess the legendary Dragon Sword. If not, run as fast as you can!
To begin with, you only have a bow and a few arrows. Use them wisely. Once you find an axe, you can fight monsters in the same cavern, but you will rarely emerge unscathed from such an encounter…
<h2>The Maze</h2>
The Maze consists of 50 caverns, each one connected to at least two other caverns. The exception is the Dragon's Lair, which only has one entrance. There are a total of twelve doors, two of which leads out to freedom; the others lead to other caverns.
<h2>The Monsters</h2>
The Catacombs are inhabited by a number of monsters. The monsters can hear you when they are in an adjacent cavern and will start pursuing you. You are faster than the monsters so you can outrun them, but once they have caught onto your trail they will follow your scent…
<h3>Orcs</h3>
Orcs are fast, but not very dangerous. However, they dig deadly pits for you to fall in. Entering a cavern with a pit is fatal, unless you possess a Flying Carpet!
<h3>Goblins</h3>
Goblins are slow, but a bit more dangerous than the Orcs. 
<h3>Giant Serpents</h3>
Giant Serpents are dangerous and hard to kill. They produce poisonous serpent muck. Entering a cavern with serpent muck is fatal.
<h3>The Dragon</h3>
The Dragon is very dangerous, very fast and almost impossible to kill. The Dragon is initially asleep on top of a mound of Gold Coins inside its Lair and won't wake up until an adventurer enters the cavern adjacent to the Lair. If you disturb the Dragon and does not possess the Dragon Sword, you have but one option: Run!
<h2>The Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>The Wizard</h3>
The Wizard magically transports himself to a different cavern every turn. When the Wizard materializes in your cavern, you may buy a Magic Staff from him. A Magic Staff costs between one and five coins.
<h3>The Hermit</h3>
The Hermit is stationary in his cavern and may share valuable information about the Catacombs if you give him a coin or two. He knows the location of the exits and other interesting caverns which are a must for the serious Catacombs visitor.
<h2>The Adventurers</h2>
<h3>Wizard</h3>
The Wizard starts the game with a Magic Staff instead of arrows.
<h3>Dwarf</h3>
The Dwarf is the strongest of all the adventurers.
<h3>Elf</h3>
An Elf starts the game with more arrows than any other adventurer. He may also shoot two arrows every turn!
<h3>Hobbit</h3>
A Hobbit moves so silently that the monsters in the Catacombs cannot hear him. A monster only enters the cavern of a Hobbit either by chance or by following his trail. A Hobbit also has a very sensitive nose and never runs into poisonous serpent muck!
<h3>Human</h3>
The Human starts the game with an axe and only a few arrows.
<h2>The Stuff</h2>
<h3>Gold Coins</h3>
Gold Coins are the currency of the Catacombs. You need them to buy Magic Staff or entice the Hermit to divulge the location of interesting caverns. Also, Gold Coins are what gets you high up on the Stone Slab of Fame!
<h3>Keys</h3>
Keys are needed to open the doors of the Catacombs. The way to freedom is behind a locked door, remember?
<h3>Arrows</h3>
You can shoot arrows to adjacent caverns using your bow and arrows. This is the only way to kill the monster without risking personal injury. However, your supply of arrows is somewhat limited. Note that an arrow fired into an empty cavern can be retrieved later!
<h3>Axes</h3>
You need an axe to fight monsters in the same cavern.
<h3>Flying Carpets</h3>
If you have a Flying Carpet you do not need to worry about the pits dug by the Orcs.
<h3>Magic Staffs</h3>
Magic Staffs are powerful weapons. The can be used both to fire lightning bolts to an adjacent cavern and to attack monsters in the same cavern. The lightning bolts fired by a Magic Staff affects all monsters in the same cavern! The only drawback is that it needs to be recharged before it can be used again… 
<h3>Spring of Water</h3>
Use a Spring of Water to replenish your supply of water. Every time you move, you consume water. If you run out of water, it's game over.
<h3>The Dragon Sword</h3>
The Dragon Sword is the recommended way to slay the Dragon.
